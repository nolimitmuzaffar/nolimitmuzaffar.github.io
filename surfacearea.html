    <p id="arcp1">This video is brought to you by Professor Bazett. He is a PhD holder and he actually contacted us with an offer we couldn't refuse (a lot of bread$). As the intelligent beings we are, we accepted his offer and let him make a video for you guys, in which he thoroughly explains how to find the surface area of a revolution. <p>

        Hello everyone, all jokes aside, I've been thinking for a while and I want to share something with you all to inspire you and change your perspective on life.
        </h4>
        <h4 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 17px;">
        Time: I hope everyone by now has realized that we have limited time on earth, of course unless one of you develops a serum of immortality but I don't know if I would want to be immortal. Anyways, can you recall your freshman year? It seems like yesterday we were sitting in our DDP classes and struggling with that Assembling Mr.whatever his name was Robot project in Inventor. And now we're about to graduate and 4 years have passed just like that. I think some of us can agree that we could have done more to improve our High school experience and maybe just put in more work whether it be in academics, extracurriculars or just getting to know people. With that said, I believe we should spend more time on what is important, instead of what is urgent. 
        <h4 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 17px;">
        Dreams: They say that a cemetery is the richest place on earth because it's filled with so many potentials and dreams that were never realized. Dreams, people, I believe we must think and dream Big. But keep in mind that dreams without goals are just dreams. Don't settle for that 9-5 job and instead be your own boss. And there will always be people who will try to discourage us from pursuing our dreams and reaching our potentials. You must shut out the naysayers, who are often unfortunately our peers or family. We were all brought to this world to leave our marks. I truly believe that we all have talents and you've got to move around until you discover what it is. We all have something that we are passionate about, something we love and care about, and I think you should keep our eyes open for that calling. One of the most important factors in achieving our dreams is being consistent. You get hit, you fail? Good. Get up, brush yourself and keep going. Never ever give up. It all comes down to how bad do you want it.</h4>
        <h4 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 17px;">
        Your book: Kevin Hart says that we're all writing a book. Your life is a book and it has many chapters. So what does your book look like? And when they close your book, how good was your book? What was the ending of your book?</h4>
<h4 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 17px;">
These are some things to think about. I will now leave you with this inspirational speech by Denzel Washington, I hope you watch it and take action.
